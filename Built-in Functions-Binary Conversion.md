# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

# Name: Prithisha S

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
temp = num
rev = 0

while num > 0:
    digit = num % 10
    rev = rev * 10 + digit
    num = num // 10

if temp == rev:
    print("Palindrome Number")
else:
    print("Not a Palindrome")



## Output
Enter a number: 121
Palindrome Number

## Result
The programs were executed successfully and the expected outputs were obtained.
